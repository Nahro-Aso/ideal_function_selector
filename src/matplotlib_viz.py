"""
Alternative visualization using matplotlib for immediate viewing.

This module provides a matplotlib-based visualization system as an alternative to the main
Bokeh-based visualizer. It creates immediate, high-quality visualizations of the ideal
function selection results that can be viewed directly or saved as image files.

The visualization includes:
- Training datasets (scatter plots with different colors)
- Selected ideal functions (smooth curves)
- Test data points (colored by assignment status)
- Statistical summaries and legends

This module is particularly useful for:
- Quick visual inspection of results
- Generating publication-ready figures
- Systems where Bokeh might not be available
- Creating static visualizations for reports

Functions:
    create_matplotlib_visualization(): Main function to create and display visualizations

Example:
    Basic usage:
    
    >>> from matplotlib_viz import create_matplotlib_visualization
    >>> create_matplotlib_visualization()
    
    This will create a comprehensive plot showing all training data, selected ideal
    functions, and test point assignments, saving it as 'matplotlib_visualization.png'

def create_matplotlib_visualization() -> None:
    """
    Create a comprehensive matplotlib visualization of the ideal function selection results.
    
    This function performs the complete analysis workflow and creates a detailed
    visualization showing:
    
    1. Training datasets as colored scatter points
    2. Selected ideal functions as smooth curves
    3. Test data points colored by assignment status:
       - Green squares: Successfully assigned test points
       - Red triangles: Unassigned test points
    4. Legend with detailed information
    5. Statistical summary printed to console
    
    The visualization uses a 15x10 inch figure with high DPI for publication quality.
    Color coding ensures clear distinction between different components:
    - Blue, Orange, Green, Red: Training datasets 1-4
    - Matching colors: Corresponding ideal functions
    - Dark green: Assigned test points
    - Dark red: Unassigned test points
    
    File Operations:
        - Reads 'train.csv', 'ideal.csv', and 'test.csv' from current directory
        - Saves visualization as 'matplotlib_visualization.png' (300 DPI)
        - Displays plot using matplotlib.pyplot.show()
    
    Console Output:
        - Progress information during data loading and processing
        - Summary statistics including:
            - Number of training datasets and ideal functions
            - Test point assignment counts
            - Best match mappings with deviation values
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If required CSV files are not found
        DataProcessingError: If there are issues with data processing
        Exception: For other visualization or matplotlib-related errors
    
    Side Effects:
        - Creates 'matplotlib_visualization.png' in current directory
        - Displays plot window (if running in interactive environment)
        - Prints detailed analysis results to console
    
    Example:
        >>> # Ensure data files are in current directory
        >>> # train.csv, ideal.csv, test.csv
        >>> 
        >>> create_matplotlib_visualization()
